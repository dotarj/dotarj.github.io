I'm Arjen Post, a passionate software developer from Groningen. To me, software development is not just my work; it's what I love to do.

I've been developing C# since .NET 1.0 and SQL since SQL Server 2000, but I also did a lot of web development (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) and some other languages (like Java, Delphi and PHP).

When building software, my focus lies on building testable, maintainable (thus readable) and scalable architectures.

In my spare time I like to develop my own projects (see <a href="https://github.com/dotarj/">GitHub</a> for some of those) and read software development books and blogs.
